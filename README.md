#SmartLiving Internet of Things Node.js library, for Raspberry Pi, Intel Edison/Galileo, Web services
Use this to connect your sensors, actuators, apps, services, controllers... cat, dog, grandmother to the SmartLiving IoT Cloud Platform, and interact with any other hardware or front-end you connect.

## Installing the library
Here's the library and a very simple getting started script

1. git clone http://github.com/allthingstalk/nodejs-client cd nodejs-client
2. npm install
3. node cli_sensor.js

Donezo.

## Playing with the examples
Beyond the basic library you can find a ton of examples that will run on Intel SBC's and some other desktop demos

- git clone http://github.com/allthingstalk/nodejs-client-examples

Here's a list of the examples
- Intel
	- Getting Started with SmartLiving & the Intel IoT XDK
	- Smart doorbell

	- Sense and interpret light values
	- Smart shop window
	- Motion dector Text-to-speech trigger
- Raspberry Pi
- Desktop demos
	- CLI sensor
	- System beep warning actuator
	- OSX Text-to-speech actuator 
	- OSX CPU temperature and fan speed sensor
	- HTTP Request actuator (Send automated HTTP Requests from SmartLiving via your own service)

## Todo list
- Provide better integration of SmartLiving widgets that can be loaded via the Intel XDK
